3 transformations from model to view space.
-Model/Object Space ;= M
-World/Scene Space :=
-Camera/View Space := 

gl_Position(Projection * V * M * P);
M ==> dependent on ==> Object world
TRS, Transformation, Rotation, Scale matrices

V ==> dependent on ==> Camera world
Projection ==> Intrinsically Camera


Example: Orthographic Projection rays are parallel from camera surface
D' = M0D

x'	????    |x
y'	????    |y
z'	????    |z
1	0001 |1

Scale matrix combined with a transformation matrix
x'	? 0 0 ?    |x
y'	0 ? 0 ?    |y
z'	0 0 ? ?    |z
1	0 0 0 1   |1

?11 := 2/R-L  
?12(-2L/R-L)-1


Perspective Projection: Light rays converge at center of projection
D' - MpD
