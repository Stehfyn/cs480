Graphics primitives

-points
-line segments
-polygons
-some curves and surfaces
	-quadrics
	-parametric polynomials

Camera spec:
6 degress of freedom:
	-position of center of the lens (CoP)
	-Orientation

Lens
Film Size
Orientation of film plane

Clipping of View Volume
-used to isolate important computation from unnecessary

Mathematical foundations:
End of rendering pipeline=2d raster (collection of pixels)
each pixel is a combination of some amount of r, some amount of g, and some amount b

i.e. a 2d-matrix

on hardware, 

it's a 1-d array of scan-line ordered, pixel data
	-interleaved
		-done on cpu mostly
		-pixels we want to talk about collectively 		may have large range gaps
		-this makes it difficult to cache efficiently
	-swizzled (z-order)
		-better cache perf
		-mostly done by gpus

color[y* width + x]

32-bit, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha

n-dimenstional vector (column vector of size n)
transpose (to row vector of size n)
magnitude = in euclidean space, the hypotenuse of coordinate combination i.e. length
normalization=produces a unit vector of length 1 unit
inner (dot) product (v1.v2)===(v1T.v2)->scalar value that produces the projection of v1 onto v2
dot product, in combo with magnitudes, can tell us their relational theta

vector(cross product) product given v1T, v2T
prove the eq, use the law of cosines=gives normal vector

determinant of the 3x3

sign of costheta tells us angle is
	acute
	obtuse
	right


At somepoint, distinguish between points and vectors

Vector Uses:
	data
		pixels, gradients
		no geometric interpretation

	geometric representation
		2d or 3d offsets
homogeneous coord systems are related in discernation


orthogonal (set of vectors, where the dot product of each pair  = 0) basically all are 90 degrees from one another (i,j,k vectors of any mag)
orthonormal (ij,k of unit mag)

space spanning

linear dependence
	set of vecs, at least one is a linear combination of 	the others
linear independence
	set of vecs, no one is a linear combination of the 	others

Vector space
	vector basis
	set of vectors can be a basis for a space if
		linearly independent
		span
	
	standard bases
		i,j (1,0), (0,1) 
		i,j,k, (1,0,0)(0,1,0)(0,0,1)

	dot product with itself = 1 =unit
	dot product with others  = 0

	All the prior aids and makes vector expansion 	trivial
	
	xi = v . vi/ vi . vi == v.vi == v (trivial)


matrix mxn (rows, columns)
	m=n (square)

operations
	addition/subtraction
	scaling(multiplying by constant)
	multiplication(not commutative)[n=q]

identity matrix
	diagonal matrix
	any matrix multiplied by this is itself

matrix transpose
	rows become columns
	columns become rows

symmetric matrix
	a matrix that is equal to its own transpose
	4 , 5, -3
	5, 7, 2
	-3, 2, 10
	A times AT = a matrix always symmetric
	AT times A =a amtrix always symmetric
	
geometric transformations
	translation
		avoiding matrix addition for translation?
	scaling
	rotation
